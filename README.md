Problem Statement: As we know that, the world is growing faster like never. Everyone is rushing to their ultimate goals. This thirst results in the development of almost every sector. Online business is one of them. We people, don’t have time to shop from the market and this is not the end. We don't even have time to choose the object from the collection. This created the embryo of online shopping, which nowadays, became a huge tree, of tons of branches.
GOAL: In this we intend to design the recommender system for movies which can recommned movies to the users.This system will recommend movies to users. This system will provide more precise results as compared to the existing systems. The existing system works on individual users’ rating. This may be sometimes useless for the users who have different taste from the recommendations shown by the system as every user may have different tastes. This system calculates the similarities between different users and then recommend the movie to them as per the ratings given by the different users of similar tastes. This will provide a precise recommendation to the user.
